<h2>Ingredients</h2> <img id="onigiri" src="images/onigiri.jpg" width="450", height="250">
<p>
    150-200g jasmine rice

    <br>4 tbsp white vinegar

    <br>Salt

    <br>Sugar

    <br>1 tin regular tuna

    <br>500g mayonnaise

    <br>4 sheets nori seaweed
</p>

<br><h2>Directions</h2>
    1. Wash the rice throughly in a pan. Drain and rinse until the water is clear. Tip: the volume of water needs to be half a finger greater than that of the rice. Cook the rice.
    <br><br><br><br>2. Once the rice is cooked, pour in the white vinegar and mix with a little salt and sugar.

    <br><br><br><br>3. Break up the tuna in a bowl and mix well with some mayonnaise, to taste.
    <br><br><br><br>4. Dampen your hands and create 4 'pancakes' using the rice. Place a flat layer of tuna on each one, then another flat layer of rice on top. Make them into balls, then shape the corners to form triangles.
    <br><br><br><br>5. Moisten the seaweed sheets, then place them under the onigiri.
