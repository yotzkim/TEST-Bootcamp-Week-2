# TEST-Bootcamp-Week-2
In this activity, you will be making a few pages for a recipe website! The text information you will need is already contained in the `.html` files. The styling is mostly up to you; you may look at [allrecipes.com](allrecipes.com) for ideas

## Setup
- Fork this repository so you have your own copy on GitHub
- Clone your GitHub copy onto your computer so you have the files locally
- Begin coding :)

## Task 1: Home Page
- Add the appropriate tags to `home.html` to make it a valid `.html` file
  - I recommend using a header and paragraph tag
- Place desired styling in `styles/home-page.html`
- Connect the two files by adding the right line of code to `home.html`

## Task 2: Recipe List
- Add the appropriate tags to `list.html` to display a list of the recipe names
  - You may want to figure out how to make lists in HTML
- Place desired styling in `styles/list-page.html`
- Connect the two files by adding the right line of code to `list.html`

## Task 3: Recipes
- Add the appropriate tags to each of the recipe html files to make the structure of a recipe
  - This will involve making lists and using multiple header sizes
- Place desired styling in `styles/recipe-page.html`
- Connect the styling to $both$ recipe files
